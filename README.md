# New-York-House-Price-Prediction---Linear-Regression-and-Model-Stability

Multiple linear regression was used to attempt to accurately, yet robustly
predict house prices with given attributes. Model stability analysis was conducted to ensure that the models built would perform relatively well on unseen data. The final model built showed that the
presence of a waterfront, central air-conditioning, construct type and the
number of bathrooms was associated with a large impact on house price.
Unexpectedly, new constructs have a negative influence on price. This
requires further examination. The final model of 9 predictors out of 16
had a MAE of 41443, the best out of our tested models. Limitations and
additional variables that may improve performance are also identified.
