# New-York-House-Price-Prediction---Linear-Regression-and-Model-Stability

Multiple linear regression was used to attempt to accurately, yet robustly
predict house prices with given attributes. The model built showed that the
presence of a waterfront, central air-conditioning, construct type and the
number of bathrooms was associated with a large impact on house price.
Unexpectedly, new constructs have a negative influence on price. This
requires further examination. Our final model of 9 predictors out of 16
had a MAE of 41443, the best out of our tested models. Limitations and
additional variables that may improve performance are identified.
